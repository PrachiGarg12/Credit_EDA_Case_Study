# Credit_EDA_Case_Study
**Business Objectives**

This case study aims to identify patterns that indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of the loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.


In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables that are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilize this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

To develop your understanding of the domain, you should independently research a little about risk analytics - knowing the types of variables and their significance should be enough.
